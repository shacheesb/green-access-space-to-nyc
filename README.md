# How Green Is Your Block? 🌳

**An end-to-end geospatial data science project using PostGIS and Python to assess neighborhood-level access to public parks in New York City.**


##  Overview

Urban access to green space is a key indicator of community well-being, environmental equity, and livability. This project evaluates how many NYC neighborhoods are within walking distance (500 meters) of a public park.

Using open data, spatial databases, and Python, I created a reproducible pipeline to:
- Load and clean city spatial data
- Perform spatial buffer and join operations using **PostGIS**
- Visualize neighborhood accessibility using **GeoPandas** and **Matplotlib**
- Quantify underserved areas


## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL + PostGIS (spatial SQL operations)
- Python (GeoPandas, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2)
- Jupyter Notebook (full pipeline + visualization)
- NYC Open Data

## Key Insights from the Analysis
🗺️ 99.97% of NYC neighborhoods have access to at least one public park within 500 meters.

🏙️ Queens has the largest total green space area (in acres), while Brooklyn has the highest number of individual park properties.

📍 A small number of neighborhoods (representing ~0.03% of NYC’s land area) are underserved by nearby green space.

👥 Population-weighted analysis showed that ~0.4% of NYC’s residents live in neighborhoods without immediate park access — highlighting equity gaps in high-density zones.

🌿 Some neighborhoods had less than 0.5 acres of green space per 1,000 residents, falling below urban health standards.

🚫 Identified and mapped the top 5 most populated “park deserts” in NYC — ideal candidates for future green infrastructure projects.

🧭 Only a small portion of parks are classified as waterfront, indicating potential for new public space development along NYC’s coastlines.

🏞️ The majority of NYC’s parks are playgrounds, followed by gardens and passive green spaces.
